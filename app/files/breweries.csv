48,wFeIiC,Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery,Brewer's Alley Restaurant,"Welcome to Brewer’s Alley, Frederick, Maryland’s first Brewpub. Brewer’s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits. Brewer’s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer’s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer’s Alley is back! Brewer’s Alley’s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early. In 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the ""new"" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer’s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it’s kind in town. As the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick’s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick’s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith’s film ""The Birth of a Nation"", and the Manhattan Opera Company’s production of ""Madame Butterfly"", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows. Brewer’s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland’s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold. We are most happy to oversee the building’s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.

57,QJRQhZ,Greenbush Brewing Co,Greenbush,"Good ideas often start over beer. Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon. So with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. ""We're on to something"", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.

It goes without saying that we follow the German Beer Purity Laws. ONLY FIRST-CLASS RAW MATERIALS WILL DO HERE We are extremely careful about raw materials. The water, the most important prerequisite for a good beer, gives us a strong advantage in quality. The fresh water of the Swedish North is the best water from which to make beer.

Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Cascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20” Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA.

98,APW1BC,Goose Island Beer Company,Goose Island,"When the first Goose Island Brewpub opened its doors in 1988, domestic, mass-produced beer was deeply ingrained in Midwestern culture. The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he’d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes – John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that. The key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process – while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers’ tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island’s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers – and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born. It turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island’s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone’s throw away from historic Wrigley Field. Today, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",http://www.gooseisland.com/,N,verified,1800 West Fulton Street,Chicago,Illinois,60612,1-800-466-7363,41.887107,-87.6720969,N,Y,N,production,Production Facility,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:21 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:21 UTC

For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response: ""Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something..."" The word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. Well, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing.

We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles. To better integrate with a meal and make our beers more ‘sessionable’ in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a ‘spice beer’, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness. In the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder.

231,0cACKo,Lucid Brewing,Lucid,"In July 2010, over a craft beer at a local restaurant, Eric Biermann and Jon Messier had a Lucid thought – “Let’s throw away the ties and the corporate ladders. Let’s start a craft beer brewery!” That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing. In June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality. They quit their day jobs. With that leap of faith – and a ton of support from many friends and family – they started building their brewery from the ground up. Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric. They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank. So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away. They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer – AIR. A beer made to get the job done. Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite “go to” beer. By October the brewery was complete and cooking. And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving… in Jon’s car. Lucid was on its way! Always keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover’s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers’ demands.

235,VPHkaP,Alaskan Brewing Co.,Alaskan,"Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers. In 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation. Marcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. ""Why not start a brewery?"" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not. Maybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska. While researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber. In December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",http://www.alaskanbeer.com,N,verified,5429 Shaune Dr,Juneau,Alaska,99801-9540,907-780-5866,58.3570171,-134.4893459,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:22 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:22 UTC

Lebanon saw many conflicts throughout its existence, and throughout the bombardments, Almaza still kept brewing its beer, changing its name to the Brasserie Almaza S.A.L. in the 1990's. In 1995, Almaza beer became the only beer brewed in Lebanon (no longer true, ever since the 961 Brewery opened in Beirut in 2006). In 2002, the Heineken group purchased a significant portion of the brewery, which means I'm not sure if the beer I purchased was actually brewed in Lebanon. In addition to the Almaza pilsner, their flagship, they began brewing Rex strong ale (8% ABV) in 2004 and Almaza Pure Malt (6% ABV) in 2007; they originally began experimenting with additional styles in the 1990's.

There are several reasons why we selected the name ‘Fifty West’; the most obvious being the fact that our brewery is located on Route 50, which extends from Coast to Coast- it spans more than 3,000 miles starting in Maryland and stretching all the way to California. The brewery is located in a building that has a vast and varied transient history (http://www.cincinnati.com/dining/heritage/history.html); from the settlers heading west through the Ohio River valley, to the days of Prohibition when our building was a favorite of George Remus and the bootleggers running whiskey from Cincinnati to Chicago, to where we are today—amidst a renaissance of the craft beer movement. To us, it’s not about the destination, but instead making sure we are enjoying the journey, appreciating the moment, and brewing beers that are enjoyed by anyone who is willing to let us become a part of their journey.",http://www.fiftywestbrew.com/,N,verified,7668 Wooster Pike,Cincinnati,Ohio,45227,(440) 477-0163,39.138724,-84.353144,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:22 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:22 UTC

Not this time around. A brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family’s, employees’ and customers’ drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery…Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns. Can true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man’s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to…A madman’s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers. True patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what “pour to the line” means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin…still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery… True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead. Some things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you’re done, you’ll either get it or you won’t.

380,63i9qL,Cahaba Brewing Company,Cahaba,"Cahaba Brewing Company was founded in the summer of 2011 by a group of friends united by their love of craft beer and home brewing. They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham – Alabama. The group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South. The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room. The building was selected for it’s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion. From the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles. To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job. As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery. After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go. The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks. Cahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating ""Last Pint Night"" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.",http://cahababrewing.com/,N,verified,4500 5th Ave South,Birmingham,Alabama,35222,205-578-2616,33.526729,-86.764854,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:22 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:22 UTC

REUSE, RECYCLE & REDUCE Elbow grease is an understatement to how we built our brewery. We spent hours on end thinking of ways for us to recycle, reuse and reduce our footprint. We started by making all of the furniture in the brewery out of shipping crates and pallets and continued with repurposing items to make our taproom. We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer? WHY DOES THIS MATTER? We want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you.

393,enoxkn,Brevard Brewing Co.,Brevard,"The world of beer is increasingly one of two extremes. While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next. At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds – beer that is both drinkable and flavorful. We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. What’s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales. They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world. But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales. The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable. While German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years. I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA. This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers. No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.",http://www.brevard-brewing.com/,N,verified,63 East Main Street,Brevard,North Carolina,28712,"",35.2333243,-82.7333116,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:22 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:22 UTC

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999. Using equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm. Their Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse. Hoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area. Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising ""Brew your own beer"". He was immediately hooked.

The brewery was Aurora, Colorado’s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin’s love of nautical history. Dry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock. In 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde. In September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock’s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter’s canoes and the area gained the nickname “Canoe Room,” which stuck. Dry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock’s Amber Ale).

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010. Saisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions. Funkwerks’ two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year. Funkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado.

Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans. When Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility. Once Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago. Currently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state.

516,POBUM3,Creature Comforts Brewing Company,Creature Comforts,"Creature Comforts was founded by people passionate for starting a craft brewery in Athens, GA, a town that we love and that has the potential to be a craft beer hub and destination for the South East. The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA. David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments. David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today. David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory. Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery. With the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens. The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over. Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities. One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings. The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world. Approximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece. We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer. Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts. Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice. We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events. Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have 20+ years of experience. What started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life. Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort. Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.

That was goal from the first night of brewing—it was love at first smell. PSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries. Back in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today. I grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife’s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.

599,jmyqSv,Geaghan Brothers Brewing,Geaghan Brothers,"In the spring of 2010, Larry and Peter Geaghan began exploring the idea of expanding operations at Geaghan's Pub to include a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Maine. Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success. Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation. Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position. In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project. Moving from an idea spoken about “off the clock” to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape. The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas. Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings. Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors. As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area. In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape. With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for. In December 2011 the idea became a reality.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds.

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts. Soon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the ‘Port Melbourne Brewing Co’ operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne. In 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family – an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution. In 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury’s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant – so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers. Throughout the years we’ve produced some of Australia’s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards.

Their love of beer and the quest for mountain living lured them to move to Revelstoke to create the brewery in 1996. Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. Bart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. The brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site “This Old House meets the World Wide Web”—letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together. He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers. Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order). Flying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century.

710,Oj9rBb,Short's Brewing Company,Short's,"THE SHORT’S STORY BEGAN IN 2002 when a 22-year-old brewer named Joe Short registered Short’s Brewing Company as a business in the state of Michigan. Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them. Renovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short’s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004. Of building the pub, Joe said: “Words cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short’s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short’s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short’s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.” Though the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe’s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business. Short’s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer. The only thing that stays the same at Short’s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own “Brewtique,” Short’s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. Today Short’s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan’s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.",http://www.shortsbrewing.com/,N,verified,121 North Bridge Street,Bellaire,Michigan,49615,231-533-6622,44.976269,-85.210357,N,Y,Y,brewpub,Brewpub,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:23 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:23 UTC

796,BumlJd,Public House Brewing Company,Public House,"In 2010, Josh & Beth Stacy and Josh & Trisha Goodridge--longtime friends--opened Public House Brewing Company in Rolla, MO, the town's first brewpub. But it was a long, long time in the works. Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing. So here goes.... Josh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings. Totally normal--with one exception. His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer. Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby. Josh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons. Fast-forward a few years. Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since). Even more years went by. Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer. Yes, beer. At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers. It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers. Goodridge was hooked. Many weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast. The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day. That always loosened the tongue. Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level. Goodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember. On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea. Enough was enough, he told her. He immediately called Stacy and said, ""I'm coming over to your house."" Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth. ""Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job."" Josh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen. Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla. Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. One week later, all the beer they had made was gone. It was a hit! The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map. Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri. You are invited to come in and have a pint with us. Cheers!

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards. Owners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern. Upon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational. The company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning ""tough"". They render the name into English as ""The Sturdy Brewers"", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ. Following current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.

You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days. As the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it. We tried every beer imaginable. We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer. And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork. In the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport. Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown. Next we started the renovation. Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown? We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. The promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer. Today our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC. We’re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.

Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style.

Because of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened. In keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible. In 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be ""listening to live music and drinking craft beer."" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company. There was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property. After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know. It was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory. Everyday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense. From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running ""off the grid"" as well. Ken, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY. There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

Today, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney. They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks. Joleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house. In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born. The barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company. Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a “nanobrewery”, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.

In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and cafés with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery. Twenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family – thus the name The 3 Brewers – “three” for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare à Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.

It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught. According to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.

Really, the garage is a hub. A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return. We hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You’ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say “Yes, sir.” You can almost smell the oil and beer. But more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It’s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age. For Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan’s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He’s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it’s a pretty extraordinary family.) So welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You’re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented.

After several years of slugging it out in the brewing community working for other brewers, Matt Phillips (the patriarch of Phillips Beer) decided it was time to make beer of his own. But while Matt’s beer was incredible, his business plan was not (at least according to the banks) and nobody would lend him the money to start the brewery. Undaunted, he grabbed credit card applications on the way out, filled them out the same day, and opened Phillips Brewing Company on a mountain of credit card debt. What palatial brewing fortress did this high-interest financing purchase? A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again. Phillips’ first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure. In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA; a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come. Since then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town. We have launched a soda company, a distillery, and most recently a malting facility–the only one of its kind in Canada.

1008,PgnRc3,Boxcar Brewing Company,Boxcar,"Boxcar Brewing Company is a community-oriented brewing company providing fine crafted beer to be enjoyed with family and friends. The idea for Box Car Brewing Company originated in 2006 in Tennessee at the wedding of two of its chief members Jason and Kristen Kohser. In the mountains of Tennessee gathered a very small group of friends and family including Jason’s cousin Kymberly and her then boyfriend Jamie Robinson. After an intimate ceremony, the entire group enjoyed a reception complete with homemade guacamole and a tub full of crudely marked “homebrews” prepared by Jason. Prior to this, he had been working in high-end restaurants as a general manager, bartender and food server for over 20 years. He spent several years in Northern California learning the fine art of winemaking at a local winery in Sonoma. During this time Jason realized the beauty of brewing beer and his desire to share his creation(s) with others. He’s been brewing out of his kitchen sink for several years now, slowly perfecting his recipes, offering to teach others the art, and, most importantly, making and drinking some real good beer. Jamie, who has yet to find a brew he will not try, immediately was interested in Jason’s creations and quickly started picking his brain on the processes and formalities for creating these “homebrews”. While sucking down a few well-crafted brews in the hot sun, Jamie and Jason talked about their love of beer and the groundwork was laid. A few months later, Jamie received a phone call from Jason, who had been mulling over the possibility of moving forward with the beer making, he then proposed the idea of moving to Pennsylvania. Jason asked if Jamie would be interested in working together and the dream of opening a brewery was declared. In 2007, Jason and his wife moved to West Chester, PA where many of his family live. Together with the other three members the idea was hatched to get serious and start brewing beer on a larger scale, for the beer lovers in Chester County, PA.

1010,MEZupX,Bozeman Brewing Co.,Bozeman,"With necessity being the mother of invention…Bozeman Brewing was born. Let us explain… When Todd Scott met his future wife Lisa Danzl while both were working and playing in Yellowstone National Park in 1986, they conceived a dream together: To one day live off the land. It was a dream inspired by a trip to Alaska and a love for the outdoors, and one day, darn it, they were going to make it happen. The couple moved to Tahoe, where Todd put his culinary degree to work as a sous chef while they skied. It was here that they decided it was time to become self-sufficient. Todd had every intention of making their own soap, toothpaste, even toilet paper. But one thing haunted him… he didn’t want to live without beer. He had no choice; the first step was to learn how to make his own. And that was also the last step. Todd’s natural knack for home brewing, made with borrowed equipment, quickly trumped the couple’s off-the-grid dreams. And let’s just say that Lisa wasn’t all that disappointed…now she didn’t have to use the homemade toilet paper for starters, but she also got to drink some damn good beer. Todd and Lisa had never tasted such fine brew, and they knew they were on to something special. That was just the beginning of the journey towards Bozone beer. The rest goes something like this… Todd refined his beer making skills for a brewery in Calistoga, while working another job and taking classes on the art and science of beer fermentation at UC Davis. But all the while, Montana beckoned. Todd scored a job as the head brewer for Spanish Peaks in Bozeman―a position he held for 10 years―and Lisa worked for the City. When Spanish Peaks moved production to California, Todd and Lisa knew it was time to bring their own fine brews to the beer drinkers of Bozeman. They bought the equipment and opened the doors to the Bozeman Brewing Company warehouse in 2001, on the edge of Bozeman’s historic Brewery District on the north side. There, Bozeman Brewing’s flagship beer, Bozone Select Amber Ale (based on a recipe that Todd had perfected over the years), made its way to the beer drinkers of Montana and beyond. Today, the same warehouse rotates more than 4 seasonal ales and lagers, along with the regulars Hopzone IPA, Plum Street Porter and Bozone Hefeweizen, all on tap in the Bozone tasting room. And today, Bozone beers have truly become a Montana state of mind…",http://www.bozemanbrewing.com/,N,verified,504 North Broadway Avenue,Bozeman,Montana,59715,406-585-9142,45.685188,-111.0238569,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:23 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:23 UTC

1031,cKudBu,COOP Ale Works,COOP Ale Works,"COOP Ale Works began with a humble home brewer and a simple dream. The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond. With the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution. The outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you – the fan of COOP Ale Works – will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own.

Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the “blueprint” for great beer was born! Eric’s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint. Better than a recipe, a brewing “blueprint” combines science and great culinary skill to create a Brüeprint. It’s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery—Brüeprint Brewing Company.

There are always ways to improve yourself and your methods, hiding just below the surface. The parties, jokes, and fun we seem to be having? We have created our own world in which to reside, and we love sharing it with all those that want to partake. I promise you, there is no greater joy, professionally. The painfully fleeting span of the human life is much too short and precious to spend it being anything less than the best you can possibly be in your chosen vocation. We love the work we do, for its own sake. We spend every day trying to get better, and we treat the opportunity to give this beer to the people of Maine every week as the gift that it is.

As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors. The restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000. In 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.",http://www.potosibrewery.com/,N,verified,209 South Main Street,Potosi,Wisconsin,53820,608-763-4002,42.6716654,-90.7271709,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:24 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:24 UTC

More of the guys’ improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn’t go away.

1350,WF34ng,Naked City Brewery & Taphouse,Naked City Brewery & Taphouse,"Once upon a time, there were two dudes named Donald and Don. One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe. Don and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY. Every patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history. Two years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world. Two and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.

He is Wicked from the ways of the world, so many demands, too many deadlines, minor appreciation, and never enough time. So with little more than the stick in his hand and the Hops in his hanker chief, he journeyed West. Upon arriving in the West he hopped from the tailgate, choked on the dust, and kicked a tumble weed rolling his direction. This is the West, the place full of opportunity “he asked himself” and sighed but after a few Wicked Cold months, the landscape began to change, grass became lush green, trees bloomed and the flowers opened. The Wicked Beaver found the warm days, and cool nights were perfect to pursue his passion.

Their love of beer began in the 90’s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer. They chose the name ""Chandeleur"" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet. Cam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they’re not brewing beer, you’re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family. As they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it. In December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company.

1370,4E9qej,E.C. Dahls Bryggeri,E.C. Dahls Bryggeri,"E.C. Dahls Brewery (E.C. Dahls Bryggeri) is a brewery and soft drink factory based in Trondheim, Norway. E.C. Dahls Brewery was founded in 1856 by Erich Christian Dahl (1814–1882), a local businessman and consul-general from Trondheim. He was the son of Erich Dahl (1774-1821) Christine Lyche (1776-1861). His parents had been the owners of an import-export business and shipping company. In 1851, Erich Christian Dahl had bought the Sugarhouse (Sukkerhuset) in the Kalvskinnet area of Trondheim, where there had been a sugar refinery since 1754. Sukkerhuset was rebuilt for brewing. The brewery stayed in the building until 1984. The first bottle of Bayerøl, a Munich-style dunkel, was sold in 1857. In 1910, the plant began to produce soft drinks at the brewery as well.

Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only ""The people's beverage"", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA.

1398,3YeQjZ,Jack Pine Brewery,Jack Pine,"Most homebrewers, at some point, begin to dream of starting their own brewery. I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer’s bias towards their own beer. A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods. It turns out, I’m my own worst critic. I’m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer. Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn’t like free beer? For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide. It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew. I was making some damn good beer! I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota. I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized. I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles. In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP. I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing. It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery. So, after all this research and planning, what’s the plan? Start small. Jack Pine Brewery is starting very small. Nanobrewery small. Brewing forty gallons at a time small. Did I mention the brewer is small? This little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery. It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment. Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!

1436,GC3a1f,Dick's Brewing Company,Dick's,"Dick Young started brewing as a home brewer in 1984 and sold homebrew supplies at his business, Northwest Sausage & Deli. When he wasn’t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer. Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick’s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers. In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick’s Brewing Company. After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick’s Brewing Company became a reality. Dick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli. He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs. Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger. Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date. When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, “I started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty”. And we are all so grateful he was. The brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008. Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states. New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009. Life was good and Dick’s Beers were flying out the door. In 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia. Dick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people. In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader. He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty. Today, the Dick’s Brew Crew is led by Dick’s daughter, Julie Young. With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick’s legacy.

Jim has been named an ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection. Jim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in. One of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: ""What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?"" Each year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre. As George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an “amateur mountaineering expedition” to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life. Horn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it’s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That’s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don’t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn’t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn’t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, “it is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.",http://www.flyingdogbrewery.com/,N,verified,4607 Wedgewood Blvd,Frederick,Maryland,21703,301-694-7899,39.361926,-77.424677,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC

In addition to these beers, Tröegs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. In late 2013, Tröegs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tröegs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tröegs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. The Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tröegs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. Tröegs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tröegs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.

The biggest trend, and subsequent impediment, in craft/micro brewing is the almost obsessive need to make the biggest, hoppiest, strangest beer possible, which is great for advancing the boundaries of what can be done with beer but does not satisfy a daily thirst. We pride ourselves on making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually want to drink whenever and with whatever. Again, great doesn’t have to be complicated. Another of our fundamental ideas is that brewing is free, and should be open.

Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques. Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions... Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.

Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle.

Esser started producing lager in a small brewery he bought in Monroe for $1,500. In 1863, he purchased 2 1/2 acres of land in Cross Plains. The original building had two cellars below and several rooms above to house Esser's family. The beer, known as Esser's Best, was first brewed in October, 1863. He was joined in this enterprise in 1881 by his son Jacob. At that time, the brewery had a capacity of 2,000 barrels. A barrel of beer cost $7, and a case containing 36 pint bottles was priced at $1.75. Jacob and his sons, primarily Werner (W.B.) and Peter (Spundt) began delivering beer to the surrounding communities, often starting out as early as 3 a.m. Werner acted as Brew master from 1907 to 1910. It was increased competition from the larger breweries that forced him to become a distributor. The first beer that he handled as a distributor was Hausmann's originally brewed in Madison in 1920, Werner became the distributor for Blatz Near Beer. Following Prohibition in 1933, the company again to distribute beer. It should be noted that during prohibition, Werner and his brothers were kept very busy taking care of the beer needs in the area, mostly doing business at night. In 1937, Werner's eldest son, Roman, became a partner. At this point, the company began to handle Old Style products out of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The family tradition continued when Del Esser, Werner's youngest son, joined the firm in 1948. In 1988, Roman's son, Wayne, took over the business. In 1990, Wayne was joined in the business by his son, Larry, which made six generations of Essers in the bee business. It should also be noted that the Essers were distributors of Blatz and Old Style products until they sold the distributorship in January 1998 to Frank Beer in Middleton, Wisconsin. Frank beer is currently the distributor of Esser's Best in the area.",http://www.essersbest.com/,N,verified,2109 Hickory Street,Cross Plains,Wisconsin,53528,1-608-798-3911,43.114731,-89.653129,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC

1598,JuFsla,Furthermore Beer,Furthermore Beer,"Furthermore bought a building way back in 2005 with the hopes of shoe-stringing together an undersized, Frankenstein-style brewery. The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even “cheap” was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn’t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. The scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the “Phase 1” section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won’t likely fix our present model. So that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the “hate” column—ant that’s always one that someone else places in the “love” column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.",http://www.furthermorebeer.com/,N,verified,525 East Madison Street,Spring Green,Wisconsin,53588,608-588-3300,43.1754057,-90.0616834,N,Y,N,office,Office,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC

Brian has been an avid home brewer for almost 15 years, while Mike has always enjoyed the culture of breweries.

With over 15 years of combined professional brewing experience and an uncanny ability to tolerate one another, they decided it was time to take a leap and chase the dream of opening their own brewery. With both Jason and Brian calling Golden, Colorado home, the choice for a location was obvious. After settling on a property on the north side of town, they wanted the brewery name to reflect the home town they loved. After doing some research they learned that the original name for the majestic Clear Creek that runs through the center of Golden was Cannonball Creek. The historical significance paired with the duo’s love for the iconic Cannonball made the decision a no-brainer and Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was born. Knowing that they wouldn’t be able to do it all on their own, Jason and Brian called upon former co-worker and professional brewer Jonathan Lee to help run the tasting room and work in the brewery.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile. The name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the ""Back 40"" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields. The craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. The company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. We've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, ""Naked Pig Pale Ale"". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about. The only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.",http://www.backfortybeer.com/,N,verified,200 North 6th St.,Gadsden,Alabama,35901,256-467-4912,34.015484,-86.005585,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC

When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! Black Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews.

Here’s the other thing. We’re adventurous. San Diego is the brew capital of the world (are we exaggerating here… NO!) There’s lots of great brewers.

After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery.

While your ""good"" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint. History - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as “up-tight” without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle. HolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one’s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew has formulated the “Liquid Confession”. What better way to cleanse one’s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one’s sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their thirst quenched simultaneously. Join the movement in guilt-free pleasure and refreshment. Have your liquid confession today and enjoy life to its fullest.",http://www.holybrew.com/,N,verified,18267 Glen Oak Way,Leesburg,Virginia,20176,703-371-4161,39.11016,-77.494771,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC

At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration. Fujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes ""KIKUSAKARI"" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'. 1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.

1831,Rx4Dnt,Fegley's Brew Works,Fegley's Brew Works,"At one of the most difficult times in the history of the City of Bethlehem, the Fegley family entered the brewing and restaurant business. The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years – a dying industrial giant of a bygone day – and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week. Bethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of ‘Steel’ and paid tribute to the region’s working class culture in it’s decor and menu. The Fegley’s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds. 2002 Most importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews. 2005 With an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who’s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess’s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the “Queen city” – from it’s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world’s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. “The All-American City” as it was known, seemed to be frosted over – and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw. 2007 In June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold’s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks – built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley’s Brew Works in earnest. 2008 In 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley’s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley’s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular. 2010 One of the nation’s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop’Solutely the Beer of the Year. Becoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable “green” practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal. 2011 to Present In 2011, Fegley’s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it’s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins “Best Summer Beer” at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader’s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list. With the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it’s capacity, and soon Fegley’s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities.

They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made—one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques. They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale. Tuppers’ Hop Pocket Ale was the result. In 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers’ Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.

1852,iBzEfC,Rubicon Brewing Company,Rubicon,"For 22 years, the Rubicon Brewing Company has been a jewel of a capital city culture. It’s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It’s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life. “This pub is part of the community, and I don’t just mean geographically,” said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. “It’s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we’re connected with the people and that they can trust that they’ll feel at home here.” Brewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he’s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim. “We’ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we’re very happy with things right now,” he said. “There is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I’m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I’ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, ‘Wow, that’s impressive.’” In some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown’s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry – first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur – Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.",http://www.rubiconbrewing.com/,N,verified,2004 Capitol Avenue,Sacramento,California,95814,916-448-7032,38.573116,-121.480958,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:25 UTC

Well, maybe our taproom/brewing facility isn’t literally in our backyard – in fact we renovated a soda bottling plant to suit all of our production needs – but with such a close-knit and supportive community, every inch of Virginia feels like home. Brothers Craft Brewing (originally Three Brothers Brewing) was founded by the three Shifflett siblings, who used their collective experience to execute a singular vision: brew exciting, unique craft beers that emphasize and support our community. It didn’t take long to realize that same community was our extended family. The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers. When thinking about the people we’ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing. Despite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we’ve gained so much family already? When we started this endeavor, we couldn’t have possibly imagined the growth we’ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we’ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we’ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.

At the beginning its founders thought of it as a hobby, but the brewery developed at such a rate that, one by one, they decided to devote themselves to the adventure full-time. The first ‘brassin’ (brewing mix) of LA CHOUFFE (49 litres) was finished on 27th August 1982. The elves of Achouffe were impatient to discover new countries, and their Dutch cousins were the first to give them a warm welcome. Even today, the Netherlands is the major destination of Achouffe Beers outside Belgium. Nowadays, more than 20 countries worldwide are supplied with our ‘nectar’ from the Ardennes forests. Coveted international awards have also been received year after year to reward their unique taste.

Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together.

Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers). We took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It’s pretty fun to have someone you don’t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn’t set out to start a business, the business just found us. “Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right” Robert Hunter We wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us. We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. Good People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit. Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company….to be good people. In September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together.

Emile, his son, takes over and moves to Ingelmunster in 1900 and founds the St-Josef brewery. Emile’s sons, Paul and Ernest, take over and expand firmly. In 1930 they build a new malt house and a foeder room and in 1937 a new brewing room, a fermentation room, a tank room and a bottling hall. Their focus still is on the traditional low fermentation beers: bock, export and lager. Luc, the son of Paul, goes to brewery school and learns the trade as an apprentice in Germany and Wallonia. Luc takes over in 1953, changes the name in brewery Vanhonsebrouck and decides to stop brewing lager and focuses on ‘old Flemish brown’, Bacchus. In 1957 he starts with lambic and later on with Gueuze and Kriek under the name Saint Louis. Brewery Vanhonsebrouck becomes the second largest brewery of Gueuze, thanks to the shirt sponsoring of FC Bruges, European soccer finalist in 1976 and 1978. The production of Gueuze Saint Louis booms to a record in that time of 1 million kg of malt. In 1980 Luc responds to the growing demand for heavy blond beers and launches Brigand, named after the farmer’s uprising against French occupation in 1798. In 1986 the family buys Ingelmunster castle and 3 years later, the famous Kasteel(bier) is launched. It starts with ‘Donker’, than ‘Tripel’, ‘Rouge’ and ‘Blond’.

She haunts the Lorelei rock singing her beautiful song, luring sailors to their watery graves.

An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff. Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.

They decided that brewing a good beer for a great country was what they wanted to do the most. When 961 Beer officially began brewing they were one of the smallest breweries in the world, and the only microbrewery in the Middle East (and still are). Although 961 Beer now brews nearly 2 million liters per year, they still insist upon making beer using the very same principles: traditional techniques, quality ingredients and love.",http://www.961beer.com,N,verified,"Mallah Building, Industrial Zone","",Beirut,"",+961-3 967 961,33.8886289,35.4954794,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,LB,,,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC

2028,HX4Prz,Skull Coast Ales,Skull Coast Ales,"Incorporated in December 2011, the Skull Coast Brewing Company, Inc., is a new entity formed for the express purpose of brewing and distributing handcrafted artisan ales, and whose history has yet to be written. Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a “Contract Brewing” or “Beer Marketing” company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name. After months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery. The Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words ""Skull Coast"" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.",http://skullcoastales.com/,N,verified,802 Somerton Drive,Fort Mill,South Carolina,29715,803-619-9295,35.011366,-80.956275,Y,Y,N,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC

It produces several beers under various brand names that come to you with the utmost care and quality that we can. As we only use particular beer ingredients, barley, hops, yeast and water, we obtain an end product which distinguishes itself from the soda flavor, the aroma, the gas and until the foam. We also do not filter out our beer as it removes the same properties and with sterilization eliminates any living yeast. Did you know that in ancient times beer was the safest way to drink water? This is because beers have a long duration without spoiling due to microorganisms responsible for fermentation yeasts. These can overlap with agents that invade their surroundings, beer, killing them. Due to the lower alcohol content does not lead to dehydration as much as other alcoholic beverages. Thus one Brew is valid for drinking from about 1 year. The most interesting is that adequately conditioned beers, depending on the style, last up to five or even more years in the most extreme cases. Our all beers last more than 1 year but because the properties change with time, to better almost always guarantee only that period to enjoy what described on the label. How do fermentation in the bottle always guarantee that the beer will live yeast to the consumer, which on the one hand clears the beer and the other creates gas in it.

In 2010 we planted our flag in Downtown Fresno, CA and decided to take our journey of becoming the San Joaquin Valley’s local brewery a step further. Our beer and brands reflect the greatness of the region we brew in. We highlight the beauty of the Southern Sierras that run along the Eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley that include landmarks such as Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Forest. We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support. Our award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery. All Tioga-Sequoia products are brewed in downtown Fresno, California.

2108,wECwS4,Far From The Tree Cider,Far From The Tree Cider,"Al and Denise Snape started the business in September 2013 in Salem, Massachusetts. Far From The Tree began fermenting apples in January 2014 and released their first cider in mid-May 2014. Although they’ve only been in business a short time, the business has been brewing for years. The Snape’s met in 2007. At the time, they were both in different careers. As a hobby they experimented with wine they had made using home winemaking kits. Al jokes that he “even came up with a way of making sparkling wine using old corks and duct tape, which considering the base materials came out pretty well!” Before long, the couple’s passion for wine deepened and they both decided to quit their jobs to move to England. Al obtained a student visa, and enrolled in the University of Brighton, Plumpton College Bachelor of Science program in Viticulture and Oenology. The chemistry and biology-intense Plumpton College program is located in Lewes, England, and takes three years to complete. It has the distinction of being the only European winemaking degree program taught in English. During breaks, Al lived in different winemaking regions while learning about that area’s wine and working at a winery. He worked in Germany’s Mosel Valley, Bordeaux and Champagne. Over the course of their time in England, they both became more and more interested in the process of making cider. Lewes’ town market had an apple press, and residents and visitors (including Al and Denise) often gathered apples from the area’s abandoned apple orchards and pressed them. Al had wanted to open a winery for years. “The idea of starting our own cider house was a bit of an epiphany during my dissertation, while studying and reading paper after paper about the difficulties of growing grapes in New England, and harsh climates in general. Time and time again the best solutions were always just to grow what worked best in that area without trying to force something to grow where it just isn’t meant to grow. Thus, the idea was born that we should make hard cider, not wine, in New England—its ingredients are what grow well here and as New Englanders that’s what makes the most sense to us. Don’t try to force it. Do what works, and do it well.” With Al’s degree and hands on experience, and the couple’s new idea of opening a cider house, they returned to the United States. After spending time on the West Coast visiting winemaker friends and exploring the region’s hard cider culture, they briefly considered moving to Washington or Oregon. A craft cider movement was underway and hard cider bars were a growing trend in both states. After their wedding in New York State’s Finger Lakes region, the couple decided to settle on the East Coast. Only a day or two after they married, they began the process of launching and searching for a home for Far From The Tree. They found that home in Salem. Located on Jackson Street, Far From The Tree operates in the unheated cellar of a building that they share with their landlord, who runs a marine construction company. The entire back section of the cellar contains an abandoned walk in freezer. Oak barrels fill the front and back sections of the room. It is, Al notes, perfect for them. “It’s wonderfully designed to hold a constant temperature. The Champenoise knew digging 50 feet down into the limestone would be worth it for the same reason. Cider, much like white wine, needs to be kept under 60 degrees and maintain a very steady temperature as it ages. With the insulation provided by the abandoned walk in freezer unit we can very easily do this with little to no energy. I would not be able to make this cider in a conventional space without a massive investment in temperature control.” Far From The Tree’s cider bears no resemblance to large mass produced hard ciders. It is not super sweet, but rather dry and refreshing with light carbonation, and tastes deliciously of apples. That’s because the first ingredient in each of the company’s three current varieties is, in fact, pressed apples. Making hard cider, Denise notes, is a natural extension of the processes that Al learned while studying in England. Far From The Tree’s goal, she says, is to use these techniques to create a product of which the company can be proud. The company gets its apples October through April from orchards in central Massachusetts. The apples then go to a cider mill in Stow to be pressed.

Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products. Soon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water. The plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word ‘Obolon’ comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows. Built according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA.

It is one of the last remaining authentic lambic breweries of Belgium and well known for its lambic beer brewed along traditional brewing methods. Lambic matures up to three years in wooden barrels, whereupon it is blended to make Oude Geuze. Sour cherries undergo fermentation in lambic beer and after a second fermentation in the bottle Oude Kriek is born. This unique brewing process with spontaneous fermentation is possible in Belgium in the Pajottenland region, the Zenne Valley and in Brussels, because of the presence of a specific microflora. Due to the absence of succession in the family business at the end of 2002, the traditional lambic beers of Oud Beersel were threatened to disappear. Shocked by the loss of this cultural and historical patrimony, the brewery was taken over in 2005 and business was restarted pursuing the principal aim to protect the time-honoured lambic beers, as well as the cultural and historical heritage of Oud Beersel for the coming generations. This traditional brewery of lambic beers is nowadays managed in a modern way with respect for tradition and the métier. The traditional part of the production process of the lambic beers, in particular the spontaneous fermentation, the maturation of lambic in wooden barrels and the mixture of various lambic casks and vintages constitutes the core business of the company. The production process is completed in close collaboration with excellent partners who manage the industrial equipment. By the synergy between the métier and the industry, Oud Beersel offers authentic products of the highest quality. Thanks to the success of the special Bersalis beers, i.e. the high fermentation beers of Oud Beersel, investments are continuously made to optimize the production process, to achieve the most demanding quality standards and to extend the infrastructure for the time-honoured lambic beers of Oud Beersel in order to meet the always growing demand.",http://www.oudbeersel.com/,N,verified,Laarheiestraat 230,Beersel,Vlaams Brabant,"","",50.7599724,4.3047963,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,BE,,,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC

To us, there is no better place to enjoy a cold one than on the shores of the most picturesque place on the planet. After forming the concept, we had one challenge – coming up with a name. It needed to be something that had a direct connection to our town, the lower Cape and the sea. After a paddleboard trip to the uninhabited Hog Island we knew we had found the place.

In 2006 we decided to let the brewery evolve to an even more natural state, and by October of that year we were granted Certified Organic status. In a sense, we were getting back to our roots. People have been brewing organically for over 6000 years; the current practice of large-scale industrial farming with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is an aberration of traditional farming, and therefore brewing, practices. Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do. What does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible. Most of our barley is already malted right here in BC, and we are working with local farmers toward the planting of certified organic hops.

With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.

Finally more quality and tasty beer options would be introduced to Cyprus. Unfortunately as we soon found out something was terribly wrong…The beer we tasted and loved throughout Europe just didn’t taste the same… Long sea transportation and storage time in hot conditions stripped a huge amount of the taste and character of the beer we longed to see in Cyprus. Then we realized that it was up to us to get the job done. The year was 2008, we decided that we would not tolerate living in a beer desert any more. Prime Microbrewery was conceived.

2231,Emjx5Z,T.W. Pitchers',T.W. Pitchers',"When Wilson Barr and Tommy Hester met at Williams College in 2007, both were pitchers on the Varsity baseball team. However, they quickly realized their love of baseball was more than equaled by their love of a good drink. Despite the desolate landscape of college get-togethers where there was a strong emphasis on a drink's quantity over quality, Wilson and Tommy were able to find a shared interest in the craft beer industry. When they started an alcoholic beverage company, their adventurous attitudes translated into a desire to create a product that was truly new and exciting. The result was T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite®. While in college, Wilson lived in Europe and discovered that generations of British pub-goers have enjoyed blending lager and hard apple cider. He was astonished to learn the popular concoction had only sparingly made its way across the pond to the United States. Ready to undo this injustice, he returned from his trip and founded W.G. Barr Beverage Company. Tommy was brought on board, and the dynamic duo got to work bringing Snake Bite – a bottled blend of lager and cider - to the thirsty people of America. T.W. Pitchers’, which stands for ""Two Williams Pitchers’,"" or ""Tommy and Wilson, Pitchers,"" was immediately settled on as the brand name. After months of hard work and many late nights spent taste testing, Wilson and Tommy launched T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite in San Francisco. Armed with their Airstream office, a little bit of know-how, and a whole lot of gumption, Wilson and Tommy are committed to quenching your thirst, one bottle of Snake Bite at a time.

Greg found a special brewer’s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result of this private yeast and of course, High Point’s careful and proper brewing methods. The name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base.

2237,pMP4Bd,Reading Brewing Co,Reading,"Reading Brewing Company was an American beer brewing establishment founded by Philip Bessinger in 1886 in Reading, Pennsylvania. Reading produced a Pennsylvania Dutch Lager at a volume of 1,200 barrels a year. The brewery raised its production to approximately 50,000 barrels a year by 1891. Reading suffered from difficulties after Prohibition began in 1920. From 1928 to 1933, the brewery was closed down. The facility itself was almost dismantled, but U.S. Marshals had trouble breaking the padlock on the front door and eventually left the plant intact. After considerable litigation, Reading brewery reopened in 1934. From 1934 to 1951 Reading ran a 'retro' advertising campaign which played on the nostalgia for simpler times. In 1958, due to flagging sales, Reading re-branded as ""The Friendly Beer for Modern People."" The change proved successful in reversing the slump and Reading made strong sales that lasted into the 1970s. In 1976, Reading ceased operations due to increasing pressure from larger macro brewers.[1] The label was purchased shortly afterwards by C. Schmidt & Sons. The brand changed hands several times until 1999, when it was again retired. In 2006, the Label was revived by Legacy Brewing, which produced original Reading recipes. In 2009, the Reading label and its recipes were purchased by Ruckus Brewing.","",N,verified,525 Canal Street,Reading,Pennsylvania,19601,610-376-9996,40.3258074,-75.9286767,Y,Y,N,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC

That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation. Thanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama. At Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking. Yellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA.

2253,jLYLAw,Brauerei Reissdorf,Brauerei Reissdorf,"During the period of promoterism – at the end oft he 19th century – the breweries in Cologne sprang up like mushrooms. In this era the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF – then called OBERGÄRIGE BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF (TOP-FERMENTING BEWERY) – was founded in the Cologne quarter “Severinsviertel” in 1894. Its founder, Heinrich Reißdorf, derived from an old-established farmer family who were based in Zieverich – today a quarter of Bergheim/Erft – as farriers and coach builders. A few years later, in 1905, the name Kölsch was established for the top-fermented Cologne beer-speciality. Before, it was called “Wiess”. After Heinrich’s death on 25.02.1901, Gertrud Reißdorf managed the brewery until 1908. The continuance of the company had never been in danger, though, since the Reißdorf couple had five sons, Johann Hubert, Heinrich, Hermann, Friedrich and Carl Reißdorf. When the product range was diversified to further styles of beer – Märzen, Export (both a strong variation of Lager) and Pilsen – in 1923 the top-fermenting brewery was renamed to BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF – OHG. In 1917, when the men had gone fighting in World War I, Friedrich’s wife Katharina managed the brewery. The two had three sons: Heinrich Reißdorf, who was killed in an accident in the brewery in 1936; and the two proprietors Hermann-Josef and Karl-Heinz, who died in 1996 and 1997. They led the company through economically difficult times after World War II, when the brewery was destroyed to the extent of 90%. Against all odds, the two brothers managed to produce and bottle a “Einfachbier” (literally: simple beer) with 2-4% vol. alc. Today the business is continued in the fourth generation. Due to a prosperous development of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF, a new site for the brewery had to be found within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. Therefore, the company purchased premises in an industrial park in Cologne-Rodenkirchen. With the new production facility, a brewery with most modern brewing technology was built, which meets the highest quality criteria. Continuity and a sense for the necessary are the virtues which make possible to look back on 110 years of an existing PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF. The ongoing success and the positioning of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF in the highly competitive Kölsch-sector confirm this corporate philosophy imposingly.",http://www.reissdorf.de,N,verified,Emil-Hoffmann-Strae 4-10,Kln,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"",49-(0)2236-/-9655-0,50.87533,6.99444,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,DE,,,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC

As it happened, there was a foot soldier by the name of Joseph Lögler amongst this troops, who was proficient in brewing beer. The short form of Joseph is “Sepp” or “Seppel” for “little Joseph”. Obviously, by making beer the brave soldier Seppel was of much better use to the King of Sweden, because he was going lame due to an old battlefield injury to the leg. The injury was the cause for his nickname “Schlappe-Seppel”. The beer of the brave soldier was very well received because of its excellence and very soon after the first brew, he had to make more beer.

2292,uV6ou7,Stroh Brewery Company,Stroh Brewery,"A name as important to the success of Detroit as Ford or Chrysler, the Stroh family began with humble roots, brewing beer in a family-owned inn during the 18th century in Kirn, Germany. In 1848, during the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side, immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion's Head Brewery, adopting the Lion's Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany – the same crest that adorns Stroh beers today After establishing the brewery, Bernhard's son, Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality, he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles. The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting in a more flavorful brew. During Prohibition, the Stroh family operated the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today. The Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964 the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue other markets. In 1973, Peter Stroh's willingness to depart from years of tradition enabled Stroh's to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow for many Stroh's employees. Stroh broke the company's tradition of family management and recruited managers from other companies. He also introduced a light beer, Stroh's Light. Though the brewery encountered many difficult times, the tradition and quality of Stroh's has never changed, and the quality of Bernhard's family-owned beer continue today, with Stroh's and Stroh's Light.",http://www.strohbeer.com/,N,verified,"",Tampa,Florida,"","",27.94653,-82.459269,Y,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC

Beers were brewed on Sunday mornings, where biscuity malt and hop aromas would waft through their house waking up their two other housemates. Before too long they realised they wanted to brew these beers every day of the week and share their passion of brewing and drinking good beer with the rest of London. Recipes were put together, brewing vessels were purchased, an industrial premises was let and the brewery in Summerstown, London, was born. Alex Bull and Chris Mills, the co-founders, had put together a microbrewery based in South-West London which created small-batch full-flavoured ales. Initially, four flagship ales were brewed for cask ale and bottles, with new on-off limited edition beers being created every month. Within 18 months of operation the brewery was expanded with new vessels installed and a Brewery Tap was added. The expansion enabled keg beers to be produced, including a variety of lagers and stronger craft keg beers, with our Brewery Tap serving our beers directly from where they are brewed. We now produce four flagship ales and at least three varying seasonal ales every month. We also produce five flagship bottle beers which are sold to many of London’s finest beer bottle shops and also have two flagship keg beer(our Crafty Lager 5.3% & Wolfie Smith Amber Ale 5.2%) with four seasonal kegs beers.",http://www.bythehorns.co.uk/,N,verified,"25 Summerstown, Wandsworth",London,"",SW17 0BQ,+44 203 417 7338,51.4325056,-0.1847287,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,GB,,,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:26 UTC

Originally, the concept was to open a really cool beer bar, bringing beer from around the United States and Belgium and making it available for the local enthusiasts to enjoy. However, we soon realized we were somewhat limited and constrained by which beers were actually available in the Miami market -due to distribution and other factors. And since we're all about unfettered drinking and out of the box thinking, the concept soon changed to: ""let's brew our own!"". This way we would be free to experiment with both well known and more obscure styles and experiment with flavor profiles and combinations. The possibilities, which once looked constrained, now appeared limitless. Enter Robert Tejon and Seth Hammond! After meeting and networking within Miami's local brewer community for the better part of a year, Diego met Robert and Seth. They decided to start making some test batches, which eventually led to making one-off pilot batches for nationally-renowned events (please see our ""events"" section). As momentum gathered, we realized that there was great potential in this concept and decided that the brewpub was definitely the way we wanted to go.

2387,epip51,Treehorn Cider,Treehorn,"Treehorn Cider started with a conversation among friends in Fall 2013. We all love craft beer, good wine and great food – especially from local producers. Hard cider began popping up in the craft beer cases around town. Local hard cider production in North Carolina and across the country was starting to take off. So we asked ourselves – why not Atlanta? Our home city has a vibrant farm-to-table restaurant scene, and more than 60 farmers markets. North Georgia has robust apple production. Craft cocktails, small-scale craft breweries and local restaurants dominate growth in the city. We would jump on the chance to taste a locally made hard cider, so why didn’t we make it ourselves? So it began. We carefully considered where in Atlanta to base our business, and ended up just where some of our partners grew up – Marietta. We leveraged years of home-based cider making, and started figuring out how to make the best cider – clean, refreshing and pleasantly sweet, while avoiding the cloying taste and heavy back-sweetening found in most national brands. Treehorn Cider is available in restaurants, bars and growler shops throughout Georgia. We love talking and thinking about cider, and above all making cider that you can drink with any meal, any time.

Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don’t even know any icebergs. Our soda’s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They’re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn’t need to be watered down.

The umbrella brand Laško is represented by the following products: the Laško Zlatorog, the special beers Laško Club, Laško Dark, and Laško Light,  the light beer Export Pils and the sweet beverage Laško Malt with apple and peach flavours. In addition to the above brands Pivovarna Laško also produces the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun.

2449,W6h1pn,Brew by Numbers,Brew by Numbers,"ABOUT BBNo. Our history, our future and what drives Brew By Numbers. THE BEER At Brew By Numbers (BBNo.) we strive to create new, exciting and forward-thinking beers focusing on quality and drinkability. Whether developing new styles, adapting established ones, or bringing the less well-known styles back into the limelight, we create each beer with the same level of care, attention and respect. All of these carefully crafted beers are brewed with the finest natural ingredients and packaged alive, in both bottle and KeyKeg, to ensure a natural carbonation and allow flavours to evolve over time. The harshest critics of our own work, we only release beers that are of a high standard, balanced and drinkable. THE INSPIRATION Before brewing together, Dave and Tom took their inspiration from opposite sides of the world. Dave discovered craft beer in Australia and New Zealand, while Tom, introduced to The Kernel Brewery during the early days, was blown away by the intensity and variety of flavours that come from the new world hops they were using. Since brewing together, Tom and Dave took a trip to Belgium for the Festival of Spontaneous Fermentation – a weekend dedicated to Gueuze and Lambic beers – and were taken aback by the refreshing crispness of Belgian Saisons and the funky acidity created by the wild yeast Brettanomyces, intrigued by the herbal and spicy tartness of Witbiers, and blown away by the rich complexity of the Abbey style ales. Brew By Numbers continues to draw inspiration from other breweries in the States and the UK as well as taking inspiration from flavour combinations from everyday life. THE BEGINNING Tom and Dave met in China on a rock climbing tour around Asia. After hanging out on the rocks and riding motorbikes around Vietnamese islands and the hilly borderlands between Laos and Myanmar they formed a solid friendship. In April 2011, Dave returned from travelling after two years in the Antipodes, drinking craft beer and doing some basic homebrew. At the same time, Tom – an old friend of Toby from the Kernel – was drinking their IPAs and Pale Ales, wondering how he could do them differently. By August that year Dave and Tom, committed to opening their own microbrewery, had secured the use of a friend’s basement on Southwark Bridge Road and built a simple homebrew kit. Through reading books on brewing, researching online, and asking for tips and advice from friends in the industry, Dave and Tom began to teach themselves to brew. The first three brews were made with malt extract, boiled with hops to give flavour and bitterness, and fermented in plastic buckets. From brew 4 onwards Dave and Tom moved to all-grain mashes, using malted grains instead of extract to achieve more authentic results. Their set-up was rudimentary: a 50ltr coolbox with homemade copper manifold and sparge arm and a plastic container for both hot liquor (water) tank (HLT) and boil kettle. But results were good, and by brews 6 and 7 people were seeing potential. Dave and Tom progressed quickly. This was, in part, because they would split batches at different stages to create variations of each brew – whether at the boil to allow different hop and spice additions, in the fermentor to allow the use of different yeasts, or post-fermentation to allow the use of dry hopping, infusions or wild yeasts. By doing this, original recipes and methods were developed. In February 2012 a French Saison yeast strain was brought to London for a collaboration brew between two prominent UK brewers. That strain gradually made its way around London’s breweries, finally reaching Dave and Tom, and by brew 20 they made their first Citra Saison. Now officially Brew By Numbers, Dave and Tom took this ‘Hoppy Saison’ to the staff at Craft Beer Co. Clerkenwell for their critique. June 2012 and Dave and Tom visited Belgium with Andy from Partizan Brewing (then still brewing at Redemption) and Toby from the Kernel. Upon returning, inspired by the trip, BBNo. brewed their first Brett-aged Saison and began planning to brew Witbiers and Belgian Blonde Ales. In July 2012 a generous philanthropist donated enough money for Dave and Tom to move to stainless equipment – for HLT/kettle and mash tun, at least. This investment allowed many upgrades that would help BBNo. achieve their goal of selling beer brewed in their basement space. They achieved that goal when in November 2012 they received permission from Southwark Council to brew beer for sale and on December 1st hosted the official launch party of Brew By Numbers at The Craft Beer Co. in Clerkenwell. THE BREWHOUSE With the recent flourish of microbreweries in the UK the demand for and cost of used brewhouses is high. BBNo. was faced with two options: spend a lot on a small, second-hand brewhouse, or create our own. The choice was easy, so inspired by the craft breweries of Australia and New Zealand – where brewery-specific equipment is scarce – we decided to convert used stainless soft drink and dairy vessels to create our own bespoke brewhouse. BBNo.’s brewhouse has one of the smallest footprints of any 12 barrel (bbl) brewery in the UK, with a gravity fed whirlpool allowing the brewers to use hop pellets in the boil for maximum flavour extraction. The cladding and banding were all done by hand, in-house, with the help of some volunteers. Now the brewhouse is finished, the old tanks are ready to enjoy their latest incarnation, making some of the finest beer south of the river. THE PILOT KIT Experimentation has always been a mainstay of our approach to brewing. With the 12bbl brewhouse up and running our original brew kit has become our pilot kit. On this kit we develop new ideas and recipes, testing new ingredients and creating short-run, limited-release batches. The pilot kit is one tenth the size of our new brewhouse, making the upscaling of recipes quite simple. Furthermore, wort from the large brewhouse can be collected and used to create different recipe variations. From brewing Imperial versions of the main batch to creating a series of Coffee Porters, this flexibility allows us to push the boundaries of our understanding and continually extend our knowledge. Keep an eye out for the red Pi stamp indicating these exclusive new brews. THE LOCATION BBNo. HQ stands shoulder to shoulder with other artisan producers in the heart of Bermondsey’s culinary quarter, a stone’s throw from the popular Maltby Street Market and Spa Terminus.

As you turn off Ramada Drive and onto Marquita Way, you will meander around a majestic oak tree. This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree’s historical significance. If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery…well, that’s our story at Barrelhouse and we can’t exactly prove it, but we’re sticking to it! Historians believe that Juan Batista de Anza or someone on his team carved the cross to indicate a safe place to camp. We think it makes a sweet logo, too! After you pass the old oak, make a left on Limestone Way and look for the dragon fly…you can’t miss it. Stop by, grab a brew or two and relax. Enjoy our glorious beer gardens with friends while you listen to the waterfall and experience the central coast the way it was meant to be enjoyed…outside. You can also pull up to the bar inside the brewery where you’ll feel like you’re part of the brewing action. Along with our amazing line-up of beers, we will also feature our very own custom crafted rootbeers.

Three of us had sustained minor injuries from the hard landing and required some medical attention. We were helped by some local villagers to a small monastery about a mile from where we landed. There we happened upon a freaky little friar named Fritz. While we were being cared after, Fritz told us his life story, being abandoned by his mother(a magical Pixie) and his father( a wayward Trappist Monk name La Salle who left the ministry and beer making to become an explorer). He was orphaned and left at the monastery to be raised by monks. The years pass by and Fritz learned the art of making ﬁne Belgium beers. And, as is the tradition with monks, Fritz loved sharing his incredible beers with us, the needy. One night while drinking quite heavily, Fritz conﬁded to us that his passion for beer and his lack of discipline would always keep him from rising in the ranks at the church, and that his naughty nature would keep him from ever being Head Brewmaster at the monastery. So the four of us decided to open a Brewery back in America and that we would call it the, "" Naughty Monk Brewery"". We brought Fritz with us, and we keep him hidden in the brewery, and here he brews beer, creates recipes, stalks the female employees and loves to play practical jokes on everyone.

Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not.

Nowadays, it is so easy and convenient to purchase generic products from big-box stores, that we sometimes neglect to appreciate the uniqueness and quality of a hand-crafted product. At Old Forge Brewing Company, we strive to honor personal craftsmanship. Our hand-crafted beer is made in small batches to ensure quality and peak freshness, while the healthy and delicious menu has ingredients sourced from local farms and markets wherever possible. Take the time to notice our bar, furniture, and fixtures which were all handcrafted by local wood and metal worker Keith Kocher (Lightstreet Custom Woodworking).

The brewery began production in January 2014 and won two bronze medals for their coolship ales (Category: Experimental, Subcategory: Wild Ales) at The Great American Beer Festival in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, Black Project expanded production with a small addition to the property which allowed for the expansion of their barrel program. This allowed the brewery to evolve from Former Future Brewing Company to only serving Black Project beers. In 2017, Black Project hopes to produce 250 BBL of beer and increase distribution. Every Black Project beer is fermented with microbes captured from the local environment via a coolship or foraged from nature. We believe this creates a beer that is unrivaled in complexity. Our beers are intended to have a sense of place, or terroir. No matter how hard one tried to, our beer cannot be replicated outside of our brewery. In fact, our microbe cultures are purposefully allowed to evolve from batch to batch, creating variations and interesting twists from different releases of the same beer. We are meticulous about designing recipes and processes that will allow nature to take over and create beers unrivaled in their beauty and complexity. Through experimentation and research, we are continuously developing new and different techniques for use with wild and spontaneous fermentation. We are not and do not have any intention of being a Lambic brewery. We use science and experimentation to find which processes and ingredients we want and often use that in parallel to traditional Lambic producers, however, other than the use of a coolship, we maintain no strict adherence to tradition for tradition's sake. Spontaneous fermentation is merely a starting point and core of our process, from there our research and development extends much beyond the scope of the great Belgian brewers and blenders.",http://www.blackprojectbeer.com,N,verified,1290 South Broadway,Denver,Colorado,80210,"",39.6933944,-104.9870534,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:27 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:27 UTC

After winning prizes in homebrew competitions at both the local and national level, coupled with great feedback from fellow beer geeks, Gregg and Bryan made the decision to take this passion to the next level and go pro. No gimmicks, no crap and never knowingly under hopped. Just great hand-crafted beer brewed in West London with the best ingredients, knowledge, and respect for process, and a little insanity. But why stop there? We don’t believe in being stereotyped. We love upfront in-your-face hop focused beers, but are we only going to brew these? Hell no! We love beer, and we will brew whatever we want, whenever it suits us. At Weird Beard we aim to continue making experimental, no-holds-barred beers that we feel excited about and we want to drink. Inspired by the American and burgeoning British craft beer movement, along with great music, exquisite food, epic beards, and the outstanding beer community in our hometown of London, Weird Beard Brew Co will not compromise on anything to bring the best flavours to the beer, whether it is the roasted specialty grains in a stout or the newest hops in an IPA. We create beers that push the boundaries of style, forcing the consumer to stop and think about the drink in front of them, to confront the misconceptions of what ale and beer should or can be, and who drinks it? And before you ask, yes, Gregg and Bryan do sport some very impressive facial hair. Here at Weird Beard Brew Co we are all about the beards, but not so much the sandals. We are passionate about good beer, no matter where it comes from or how it is dispensed. You will find us in bottle shops, on cask in real ale pubs and in the best London beer bars on keg.

Prohibition was repealed in the late 1950s, but home brewed beverages were still illegal because they didn't bear the proper liquor stamps. Nevertheless, homemade Choc and wine continued to be available to regular customers at Pete's, a restaurant owned by Prichard in Krebs, Okla. Those customers happen to include JFK and high-powered Oklahoma politicians.

2690,lX2XWI,Beaverhead Brewing Company,Beaverhead,"Beaverhead Brewing Company is owned and operated by Brett Maki. Brett was born and raised in Dillon. His brewing career started in Seattle in 2001 with a homebrew kit his wife purchased for him for his birthday, three short months later he found himself working for Pyramid Brewery in Seattle, making soda, driving forklift, and washing tanks. There he learned the trade of cellar work and brewing beer. When Pyramid closed its doors in Seattle, Brett moved on to work for a small brewery in south Seattle. He soon became head brewer and was put in charge of training new employees and developing new beers.

We began as a herb farm, growing culinary and medicinal herbs for the garden center trade. Our herb farm, Sunflower Cottage, grows 120,000 potted herb plants each spring from seeds and cuttings to sell to other garden centers and to our own customers. In the fall of 2012, we built our hops field. After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer. Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer. In 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries. By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley. Our first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful. We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction. In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. Life is good and we are living the dream. We now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. Our tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season. In the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.

2699,FwmqM1,Harvest Moon Brewing,Harvest Moon,"In 1996 an idea was born to start a brewery in west-central Montana with a name that reflected the region's rich agricultural tradition. Thus, Harvest Moon Brewing set up operations in Belt, a rural community located 20 miles southeast of Great Falls. Harvest Moon's first batches were available in late 1997. Soon after, the brewery developed a reputation for a well-balanced, full-bodied beer that only quality ingredients in perfect amounts could produce. The barley is grown and malted just a few miles from the brewery while the malted wheat and hops come from the Northwest. The brewery uses modern, state-of-the-art brewing equipment but is still a ""hands-on"" system, which allows brewery owners Stan and John to ensure high production quality. They oversee every step of the process, from malt handling to mashing, from wort transfer to yeast pitching, from fermentation to conditioning, and from packaging to shipping. The fine attention to detail assures consistency of production and ultimately a great-tasting craft beer!Belt, Montana, is located 15 minutes southeast of Great Falls, and is home to about 700 fantastic Montanans. Harvest Moon Brewing Company calls Belt home and has named their wheat, Belgian-style ale, Beltian White, after the town. Belt is also strategically located above one of the purest sources of water. Wells tap into the Madison Formation where constant year-round temperature and quality allow Harvest Moon to use some of the most perfect water on Earth to brew beer. Another great thing about Belt? They are located in the center of our great state, right in the middle of the grain-growers that supply our brewery with prime barley & wheat. Harvest Moon’s ties to the farming community don’t end there…after we use the grains, we supply the spent mash to a local pig farmer to feed his hogs. Hence the name, Pigs Ass Porter.

They didn’t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower. The Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be. The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry. They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted. So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing. The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter. Jason and Jason had their first failure. Poor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit. They could do much much better. Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find. Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find. Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again. The second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired. After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success! The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill. Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family. Gary Schlaff, Jason’s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013. Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix. The brewery itself will not serve or prepare food. Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery. We strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible. The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI. Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.

2803,oBe8dQ,Big Muddy Brewing Co,Big Muddy,"All over the United States, craft breweries are continuing an American tradition which experienced an almost 50 year drought after the repeal of prohibition. Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new “microbreweries” all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations. Until 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town’s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery’s demise. Big Muddy Brewing’s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago’s Rosati’s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries. It was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer. Stuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously. Stuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years. The first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg’s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good “craft beer transition brew” for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC). Kinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing’s second selection, “Saluki Dunkel Dog”, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer. The third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing’s lineup is an ale called “Big Muddy Pale Ale”, and future varieties include “Logan’s Lager”.",http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/,N,verified,1430 North 7th Street,Murphysboro,Illinois,62966,(618) 684-8833,37.7823381,-89.3321145,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,,,2017-09-24 00:25:28 UTC,2017-09-24 00:25:28 UTC

Constructing canals they delivered Rocky Mountain snowmelt waters to the thirsty mineral rich alluvial soils of the valley floor and surrounding benches and mesas. Joe’s granddaughter caught the eye of a young cattleman from a neighboring county and upon their marriage, our great-grandmother welcomed Harry Talbott, our great- grandfather and founder of Talbott Farms into the fruit-growing business. Over the decades, our company has continued to expand orchard and vineyard production and packing and processing for markets throughout the nation. In 1983 we constructed our first cider mill in the building that now serves as our retail market. As production increased in the 1990s, we built a larger cider mill that currently meets production demands. Today, in the same pioneering spirit embraced by Joseph Yeager over a century ago Christopher Leader and I (Charles Talbott) have launched Talbott’s Cider Company producing Hard Ciders so that we can show “the boys” what the sixth generation brings to the table!

2834,VajTuz,Engine 15 Brewing Company,Engine 15,"Engine 15 Brewing Co. was born of the need for great beer! Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer. Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a “beer kit” from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics. Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great. Fast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew. Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture. In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub, Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean. The three were soon making the business a reality. All that was left was a name. They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch’s 1962 Ford Fire Engine – after all, they just don’t make them like that anymore. It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause. As of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.
